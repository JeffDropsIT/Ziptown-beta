South African motorists have been hit hard by fuel increases in 2018 this is an opportunity that grants willing drivers to cut the cost on petrol budgets by sharing their rides with other daily commuters who might be travelling on the same routes as them. This application allows a driver to post an "Offer" for a ride to share according to the driver's commuting times, passengers can check for "Offers" similar to their commuting times. And also passengers can post their own "Requests" for daily commuting, and drivers can also search for passengers to share the trip to work or school.
